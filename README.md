# Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

## Task

The aim of this project is to create a JavaScript encoding/decoding web app using the Caesar cipher and an HTML user interface.

## Requirements:
   The app should
- Accept user input of plain text or coded message.
- Accept user input of the required key.
- Accept user input for choice of encode or decode.
- Given a coded message, the choice of key and choice of decode- produce decoded plain text (decoded using the chosen key).
- Given a plain text message, the choice of key and choice of encode- produce coded message ( encoded using the chosen key).

## Summary of Tech Stack
This project consists of JavaScript program and an HTML user interface that does encryption and decryption using the popular ceaser cipher algorithm. 

## Functionality
The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the text is 'shifted' a certain number of places(the key chosen by the user in this case) down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 2 as key would return the letter 'C' for the letter 'A' and so on. The functionality of the app fulfills all the requirements listed above.
